All the style sheets used in your website should always be kept together here in this one folder. If you copy the parent "default" folder to create a new "skin" or theme, everyone you need to create a new web design is grouped under one folder. Grouping all these files together allows you to keep all your UI, CSS, and design files together and makes web redesigns extremely simple and portable. Note that each of the CSS files in this folder has more detail comments about how they work. The goodies file has extra code for legacy browsers and tricks you might find helpful. Do not try and use SASS or minimization routines to rewrite these files, except for the Styles, Mobile, and Print CSS files. They will destroy or crash on the various CSS hacks, fixes, and code used to control what legacy browsers use. But you can manually remove all comments from them.
