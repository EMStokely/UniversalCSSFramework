/* ======================= UNIVERSAL CSS FRAMEWORK ======================
Title: Universal CSS Framework, version 2.0.0.0
Author: Mitchell Stokely (updated March, 2021)

Description: This style sheet is part of a complete "progressive" CSS framework designed for cross-browser style sheet support in browsers going back to the birth of the World Wide Web in the 1990's. It provides old browsers the minimum styles needed to display content, while adding newer styles for more modern browsers that can display more modern CSS. I call this the "Universal CSS Framework" because it was designed to universally support as many web browsers as possible, including those that did not support CSS. This system should provide some form of basic layout or design in all browsers, old and new, with a rich cascading style sheet system that degrades gracefully to simpler layouts in the older browsers.

The first "1.0" version of this CSS system was originally constructed in June of 2004, though its initial designs were laid down in 2001. This "2.0" version is a major upgrade I built to accommodate new HTML5 and CSS3 standards. You will see those more modern features in parts of the newer sheets designed for more modern browsers and much better fixes for many older browsers, as well.

Please note that this solution is Javascript-free!

============================ STYLE SHEET NOTES ===========================
This Bootstrap importer sheet is part of a complete CSS cross-browsers style sheet framework designed to support your CSS in browsers going back to the birth of the World Wide Web. This sheet uses special @import rules not supported by older browsers to hide newer more modern styles like Bootstrap from them and allow much older agents to use a simpler block-level layout. It allows newer browsers to access your full range of newer CSS and complex layouts that are imported in below. Using that strategy this CSS System allows you to support 99.99% of browsers going back to the 1990's, while moving forward with newer cutting edge CSS3 styles and layouts in more modern browsers. It also allows you to use Bootstrap's classes while removing its reboot element styles, supporting older browsers that need simpler styles and layouts.

============================ STYLE SHEET INSTRUCTIONS =====================
For full install instructions see the "OldBrowsers.css" style sheet. This Cross-Browser Style Sheet relies on special @Import versions of sheets below to handle cross-browser issues and add or exclude support for old and new browsers. DO NOT CHANGE THIS STRUCTURE OR COMPILE ANY OF THE CSS (like in SASS). You may compile "Styles.css" only or add your own custom CSS files separate from this CSS framework. You can remove comments in all these sheets, however, or customize the CSS as you like. The ability to cascade imported sheets over old earlier sheets relies on this @import style sheet structure below. For this reason, if you want to support older browsers, DO NOT CHANGE OR COMPILE THIS CSS IN SASS OR OTHER TECHNOLOGIES OR ALTER @IMPORT BELOW! 

================ NOTES ON THIS CROSS-BROWSER STYLE SHEET SYSTEM ===========
The following notes are added to help you understand how this sheet works and why you might want to use it:

@IMPORT: You will see below this page "imports" in additional attached style sheets into it. The specific type of @import used below is not supported in very old browsers so these newer styles and sheets below will not be seen in many older user-agents. The linked "OldBrowsers.css" sheet will be the only style sheet these older browsers get in most cases (other than print). The rules of CSS say imported sheets will add styles BEFORE the styles in the sheet that imports them, and must be imported in first or they are ignored. For that reason I have elected to not mix imported sheets with styles in this page. Imported sheets, in general, are hidden from many older browser versions, which allows you to apply specific formatting for very old browsers like Netscape 2-4 series, Internet Explorer 5.2 for Mac, and IE 3 and 4 for PC. These "OldBrowsers.css" linked styles gets written over by the imported sheets in newer agents. This is the motivation for why this style system was built and how it works. Thus, only the "OldBrowsers.css" sheet gets loaded and the rest of the imported ones are ignored for most older browsers. This system allows a wide range of older agents that don't support import or newer CSS to simply get a clean "reset" of their CSS which turns their pages into div blocks of content for them while hiding all the fancier CSS in your imported CSS from them. The imported sheets will cascade over all the old browser sheets and give newer browsers the latest cutting-edge CSS without affecting styles delivered to old agents in the other linked sheets.

HOW THE IMPORT CSS FIX WORKS?
Certain browsers that read the @import 'versions' below fail, and so they will be ignored. Those style sheets therefore will not be downloaded or applied to the old browsers listed below. The following @import tricks were used to show and hide style sheets from legacy browsers as follows:
------------------------------------------------------------
FORMAT: @import '...' all;
Is hidden from:
- Netscape 1-4.x
- Opera 1-3.5
- Windows Internet Explorer 1-7.x
- Macintosh Internet Explorer 1-5.x
- Konqueror 1-2.1
- Windows Amaya 1-5.1
- iCab 1-2.x
- OmniWeb
------------------------------------------------------------

WARNING: You must NOT put any styles before @import or style sheet importing is ignored in most browsers, old and new. According to the CSS specs, @import rules must precede any other CSS rules in a stylesheet or they are ignored!

/* ================== START : IMPORT IN BOOTSTRAP STYLE SHEETS ======================== */

/* IMPORT IN BOOTSTRAP's CSS LIBRARY : By "importing" in Bootstrap below (rather than via a traditional link) you hide its custom, styles from older browsers (built in 2001 and older) which would break their layouts in those older agents. This import design is critical if you want to support older browsers and allow newer ones to fully use new CSS frameworks. Otherwise, Bootstrap's styles look jumbled in many older browsers.

NOTE: IMPORTANT: MAKE SURE YOU CUSTOMIZE THE PATH BELOW TO LOAD YOUR BOOTSTRAP FILES BASED ON A PATH FROM THIS STYLE SHEET TO THE BOOTSTRAP INSTALL FOLDER! This path in CSS @Import works best as a relative path from this file's location.

IMPORTANT: You MUST use the import format exactly as is (@import '...' all;). This import text hides this imported file from ALL OLDER BROWSER (IE 1-7) and is mostly seen by newer browsers that can fully support it. Older browsers will be targeted via a "reset style delivered via a link instead ("OldBrowsers.css") that gives them a primitive block-level only text display of content.*/
/*@import '../../../lib/bootstrap/css/bootstrap-reboot.min.css' all;*/
@import '../../../lib/bootstrap/css/bootstrap.min.css' all;

/* OPTIONAL: If you use a CDN for your Bootstrap library you can use this path below instead.
NOTE: I do NOT recommend importing in a CDN CSS file like this and recommend you just use a link instead as this could cause cross-domain issues if not imported in without a special key. Note: Using a linked Bootstrap external file like that would break the cross-browser framework as all browsers would now read the CSS in the linked file.  */
/*@import 'https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.0.0/css/bootstrap.min.css' all;*/

/* OPTIONAL: Import in our custom Bootstrap cleaner "reset" file below if you want to remove Bootstrap's "reboot" sheet and start with a clean set of unstyled HTML elements. Their "reboot" sheet is a reset of select HTML elements or types to a slightly changed format to make pages looks a little prettier in Bootstrap based on a subset of HTML5 elements. They do this reboot prior to layering in Bootstrap's main class library. This cleaner would remove those styles and give you a clean default browser style instead. In my opinion Bootstrap's reboot shoot is not needed. In some rare cases you may see designs shift by using the cleaner below so comment this out if not needed. I like to clear these out prior to adding my own reset of elements as found in "OldBrowsers.css".

IMPORTANT: You MUST use the import format exactly as is (@import '...' all;). This import text hides this imported file from ALL OLDER BROWSER and is mostly seen by newer browsers that can fully support it. Example: The format of @import below means the sheet imported will not be seen by IE1-7. older Netscape 4 series, and many old browsers from pre-2001. Older browsers will be targeted via a "reset" style delivered via a link instead ("OldBrowsers.css") that gives them a primitive block-level only text display of content. */
