Store all your files that control overall website design and layout in this "images" folder. These are almost always digital image files but can also include phone app icons, favicons, emoticons, etc. Anything that works in tandem with your CSS style sheets to control overall website design should be included. Grouping all these files together allows you to keep all your UI, CSS, and design files together. I have included some sample icon, iphone, and logo images which you will want to replace with your own.
