Store all your files that control overall website design and layout in this "images" folder. These are almost always digital image files but can also include phone app icons, favicons, emoticons, etc. Anything that works in tandem with your CSS style sheets to control overall website design and layout should be included here. Grouping all these web design files together in folders allows you to keep all your UI, CSS, and design files together as a group. I have included some sample icon, iphone, and logo images which work with my HTML5 and README web page template files. But you will want to replace these images with your own.
