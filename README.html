                <p>Last Updated: 7/7/2022</p>

                <p>Author: Mitchell Stokely</p>

                <p>Summary: This is a project I call the <strong>Universal Cascading Style Sheet Framework</strong>. It is simply a small package of CSS files you drag-and-drop into your website, and which "resets" the web browser's HTML element designs so they consistently display your website's elements in many types of web browsers, past and present. This CSS system also offers you a more advanced CSS system for managing how older and newer browsers view your website's HTML and CSS by hiding modern CSS designs from older browsers and degrading gracefully your HTML layouts for those user agents. Using its carefully coded CSS import system, this framework provides superior cross-browser style sheet display and support of many types of web designs in browsers going back to the birth of the World Wide Web (mid-1990's) all the way up to modern HTML5 ones built today. As such, a web developer using this system will not have to struggle to modify CSS and HTML to fit the needs of troublesome, older browsers from the past that failed to render layouts correctly. If you are spending thousands of hours designing your websites to look good in all the old, antiquated browsers then give my CSS system a try. It will simplify your coding life by removing the need to do so in most cases, and allow you to focus more of your time doing cutting-edge CSS web page layout and design for the newest HTML5 browsers.</p>

                <h3>Version History</h3>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Version 2.0</strong> : Updated Release (2022)
                        <ul>
                            <li>The "2.0" version is a major upgrade and enhancement, and has been completely rebuilt to accommodate modern HTML5/CSS3 browsers and newer Web Standards.</li>
                            <li>The original version of this framework was written between 2001-2005, but not heavily modified/updated till this 2.0 version was created in 2020-2022. Since modern HTML5 browsers have come on the scene, I elected to update the older version of this CSS framework to make sure it still performed well in those newer web browsers.</li>
                            <li>Extensive bug fixes and optimizations were performed starting in 2020, including a complete re-examination of all older browser issues, enhancements to address issues in the Internet Explorer (v. 1-11) suite of browsers, and a retest and rewrite of the "@import" filtering system. Note that I saw no change in modern HTML5 browsers using my original CSS system that was built for older 2001 browsers. Nor did I see any changes in modern browsers in how they used the original import filtering system. That is very good news and means this framework still works in hiding newer styles from older browsers but still works great in modern 2022 browsers. Today's web browsers support all the old CSS1 technology and more, minus some deprecated HTML 3.2 and 4.1 markup not affected by this code. This version allows you to still hide your cutting-edge CSS and HTML from antiquated browsers without affecting today's modern agents.</li>
                            <li>This new "Universal" version is the first official version for public use. It combines the power of old and new CSS technology into a complete cross-browser solution that works in over 20+ years of browsers. In this newer version you will see more modern features in parts of the newer sheets which have been redesigned for HTML5 browsers and much better fixes for many older browsers that were left unresolved long ago. Also removed were highly proprietary CSS3 and technology that is poorly supported in HTML5, including many types of psuedo-classes, new form field input types, and CSS events that most modern browsers still do not support today (2022). Additional research into many older browser CSS issues was completed in this version and additonal CSS hacks applied that finalize CSS layout issues for deprecated user agents (like Internet Explorer 5-7, Netscape 4-6, etc.), should they appear in your web logs as viewers of your web pages.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <strong>Version 1.0</strong> : Initial Release (2004)
                        <ul>
                            <li>The first "1.0" version of this CSS system was originally constructed from initial designs laid down in early website builds dating back to the summer of 2001 when I restarted my software engineer career as senior developer at a small tech company in Texas. The concept of a "reset style sheet" that cleans up and unifies all the HTML elements used in web browsers was invented by a handful of web developers sometime around the spring of 2001. That is when I joined in with my own version.</li>
                            <li>In June of 2004, the official completed version was created for various software products online I had created. And from there I perfected the initial "import" filtering concept, early CSS "hacks", and the custom HTML reset sheets that would lay the foundation for solid cross-browser designs. After that, using this CSS framework, I was able to see my websites look exactly the same across many popular browsers of the time. (Many happy clients!)</li>
                            <li>Various bug fixes and optimizations were performed over many years after 2004, but the core CSS design remained essentially the same until version "2.0" in 2020. Note that since those early years, this early CSS framework has been battle-tested in very old, troublesome browsers going back to the mid-1990's. Please note also that this code had been successfully used in dozens of commercial websites over the years since 2001, including my online open source website media software and numerous other sites built for the energy, healthcare, airline, and real estate markets. So, it has worked reliably in dozens of websites and products over the years and proven reliable.</li>
                            <li>Note that I do not keep a copy of this origional "1.0" version as it has been completely rewritten and greatly improved in version "2.0". The main "@import" structure and CSS filtering design however, has remained essentially the same. But this older version would do very little today in cleaning up more modern HTML5 elements, so was rewritten.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h3>A Note on Supporting Antiquated Browsers</h3>

                <p>I realize that today (2022) most of the "troublesome" browsers from long ago are long dead. Early versions of Internet Explorer (4-7) and Netscape (4-6) browsers for example, which dominated the browser markets between 1998-2010, and which caused us so much heartburn back then, are long gone if nearly killed off or removed from the global browser marketplace. I realize many younger developers laugh at the thought of designing for even old Internet Explorer (v. 9-11), which was fully deprecated by Microsoft as a product only recently. However, I have found myself going to "major" American corporations to give presentations where obscure computers and projectors shown to thousands of people are still using old Internet Explorer version 6 - a broken box-model browser that will truly crash a beautiful HTML5 website very quickly!</p>

                <p>Why play russian roulette with your website in those situations and watch your carefully constructed designs be mangled live in front of an audience of very important people? Instead of packing gigantic clunky JavaScript API's into your projects to fix this type of problem and hope scripts will rewrite your CSS for you or design websites for the newest most popular Chrome browsers while ignoring the rest, what if you could deliver readable text and media content to over 99% of all web viewers and screenreaders known around the world?</p>

                <p>The fact is these cross-browser battles are never truly over, even today. I recently went to a major cryptocurrency product site that crashed and burned with a nasty JavaScript and layout error in three different web browsers on my phone! JavaScript does not have all the answers! The sad fact is, cross-browser issues will be with us forever, or at least as long as there are untrained developers still coding cutting-edge tech into websites that is not correctly tested and fixed in multiple web browsers. Many modern browsers still do not support big chunks of HTML5, ECMAScript, and CSS3! In the case of CSS, we must stop wasting time testing or re-coding layouts for older browsers that are over 10 years old. Yet, many will be around for many more years to come. You risk diminishing your audience and your content by failing to design for antiquated browsers. You risk showing up at an event, opening a mobile device, or logging into a PC with an older version of a browser that crashes your fancy layout in front of hundreds of customers. That is what my CSS framework tries to prevent, and why I hope you find my solution helpful in providing some relief from dealing with old browsers but with minimal work. Warning: This solution does not fix fancy CSS layouts for you, redesign grids or flex layouts in IE, or help you struggle to fix JavaScript API that fails in some smart phone browser. It simply hides cutting edge CSS from older agents while delivering clean white text pages that are clear and readable to those users, while resetting all the past and modern HTML elements so they look the same across dozens of browsers. This allows you to forget how your content will look in most of the troublesome older browsers and viewers that might pop up. You can then give 100% focus on building rich layouts for the modern browsers you care about now. Forget customizing layouts for the older browsers! That is what my new CSS system will allow you to do. But my message remains.....YES, you should care about antiquated browsers! And your layouts should "degrade gracefully" in older browsers so a wider range of users can access the valuable content in your site rather than struggling with elaborate scripts that hide valuable text content away from viewers because you wanted them to see your fancy designs. If they cannot or do not process CSS or HTML correctly, they will fail. Why should you punish them or exclude older browsers from seeing your content? Delivering clean content for everyone will benefit your web project and best of all, allow you to brag and say your website is readable in 99.99% of web browsers!</p>

            <div id="information" name="information" class="box print_pagebreak" aria-label="Information">

                <h2>Information</h2>

                <p>Welcome! I built this <strong>Universal CSS Framework</strong> to help new web developers and designers around the world learn how to code web pages in CSS the right way! After seeing so many developers struggling with basic CSS and HTML over the years, I decided to create this comprehensive "Universal CSS Framework" to help developers design websites with Cascading Style Sheets the right way, while freeing them from having to struggle hacking CSS to work in hundreds of versions of older web browsers. I hope you will use it to simplify CSS web page design, but also learn CSS and improve upon your own website coding skills.</p>

                <p>How many web developers have struggled to display their websites in older web browsers and devices over the past 20 years? How many thousands, even millions of hours have been spent on trying to get websites to display correctly in hundreds of browsers and mobile devices using Cascading Style Sheets? What if instead of your websites working in 70%, 80%, even 90% of browsers and devices, it worked and looked great in 99.99% of all known user agents ever built? That is what my CSS system tries to achieve!</p>

                <p>This Universal CSS Framework has all the code needed to start designing your web pages quickly. It is based on 20+ years of direct experience writing CSS in web pages and has all the goodies needed for your CSS to work in web browsers and devices today (2022) as well as browsers going back to the early days of the World Wide Web (1990's)! This Cascading Style Sheet system was originally designed as a "reset" sheet to align all the various browser UA style sheets and their HTML elements so they looked and worked close to the same. It does do that first! But later it was expanded to address troublesome website design issues in older browsers and eventually modified to support more modern website designs in new web browsers while hiding that newer technology from the antiquated ones. That two-part system is the core of what it achieves. As such, it provides very good cross-browser style sheet support of web designs and layouts in many types and versions of user agents, while allowing you to focus almost exclusively on building cutting-edge CSS3 layouts and designs using the latest technology and standards. It will save you thousands of hours battling HTML issues, layout problems, designing for antiquated browsers, installing and running kooky JavaScript libraries, and running time-consuming CSS preprocessors. None of that is needed now! All you need is to drag-and-drop this prebuilt, reset, CSS library of files into your project, add a few links to a few CSS files, paste in your custom CSS, and your website is fixed.</p>

                <p>Please keep in mind this system does NOT fix the middle-tier problems, like designing "grids" for Internet Explorer 8-11, closing every box-model float, etc. It is not designed to address edge cases where certain later models of modern web browsers need hacks to show layouts. It does not use JavaScript to hack and rewrite HTML or rewrite layouts. It is simply built to hide the older user agents from your newest CSS and HTML designs and deliver those user agents clean, white, vertical text pages of content. It also resets or restyles all modern and antiquated releases of all the HTML elements so that they have the maximum chance of working well in a wide range of browsers and displays consistently. It maximizes the percentage chance that restyled HTML elements will look and work exactly the same between browsers. As such, it will relieve you from worrying about what may happen to your elaborate CSS layouts in a wide range of older browsers and since they will not have access to your cutting-edge CSS designs using this new CSS framework.</p>

                <p>As such, this style sheet system is a complete and very comprehensive CSS framework designed for cross-browser style sheet support in browsers going back to the birth of the World Wide Web (since the 1990's). It provides old browsers the minimum styles needed to display HTML and content correctly, while adding newer styles for more modern browsers that can display more modern CSS features and layouts. I call this the "Universal CSS Framework" because it was designed to universally support as many web browsers as possible going back over time, including browsers that did not support CSS in the mid-1990's when the first web browsers appeared on the scene. This system should provide some form of basic layout or design in all browsers, old and new, with a rich cascading style sheet system that degrades gracefully to simpler layouts for older web browsers, while providing rich support for cutting-edge CSS3 features in newer ones. As such, this CSS system is a very simple solution to a complex problem because it simple delivers plain white content pages to older browsers while fully enabling the newer HTML5 browsers the power to move forward with complex layout and design.</p>

                <p>The way this new Cascading Style Sheet system works is it first delivers a very clean, thoroughly tested set of basic "reset" styles coded in very simple CSS1 and CSS2. These styles reset basic HTML elements styles that all web browsers and user agents use going back to the mid-1990's and early 2000's up till today. These reset HTML element designs are read by modern HTML5 browsers as well, resetting their element designs to match what older agents support. Using "@import", newer browsers are then provided an additional, more modern "reset" set of sheets, as well as the ability to process more advanced CSS that is hidden from older browsers using CSS "@import" filtering code. This layered "reset" CSS framework simplifies basic HTML elements to core style designs that reduce all layouts to plain white content pages all the older browsers recognize (this includes Internet Explorer 1-7, pre-HTML5 browsers before 2010, IE 5 series for Mac , Netscape 4 series, etc.). Text and media for older browsers then appears as vertically stacked content in simplified web layouts that allow users to access your content. But the import filters hide newer sheets which allow more modern HTML5 browsers access to more advanced CSS3 features and HTML layouts. The system then allows you to paste in all your cutting edge CSS layouts and custom CSS for new HTML5 agents, mobile browsers, etc. Again, it does this using a handful of "@import" rules that are not readable by a wide range of older browsers. All of the older browsers read your plain HTML ok, but are prevented from accessing newer CSS sheets that would display your web pages in more complex layout designs. In many cases older browsers fail to render such newer design correctly and jumble your text content, or use proprietary JavaScript or HTML code that is not understood or rendered correctly. Instead, this CSS framework delivers your page content as plain white, stacked, text-based content blocks, while modern browsers and HTML5 agents and devices will see your rich layouts exactly as designed. My system when combined with my HTML tutorial template code (see below) allows you to also deliver content to screenreaders reliably that do not read or render CSS (for the blind). And, it includes mobile design styling, and has a built in print sheet as well. This CSS framework, plus the HTML template combined, can together provide content delivery to 99.99% of all browsers, user-agents, and screen readers, allowing your web content to reach a huge audience with nearly zero customization effort needed in addressing out-dated and deprecated browsers technology.</p>

                <p>Using this style sheet framework, older browsers will get plain white, vertical content pages with san-serif black fonts, while newer and more modern browsers will get your cutting-edge, CSS3 designs. This system achieves that using special CSS rules that older browsers do not understand. These newer style sheets are hidden from the old browsers using a special "@import" style sheet trick all known modern browsers understand but older ones do not. The older browsers get a simpler reset element style sheet, while modern browsers get a more advanced reset element sheet, plus your custom CSS layout styles. This includes full support for advanced mobile and print designs using CSS. The following older browsers are now hidden from these newer style sheets using @import rules in this CSS framework:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Netscape 1-4.8</li>
                    <li>Opera 1-3.5</li>

                <p>EASY TO INSTALL! To install this project, simply cut-and-paste this CSS project into your website, add a few links in your HTML page to the CSS files, and you are done! Your site is guaranteed to look great in browsers going back to the 1990's! No more struggles trying to fix layouts in old Internet Explorer, or trying to understand why text and layouts shift between web browsers. All text and layouts and HTML now align across all browsers! You just need to follow standard HTML markup structural rules in adding clean markup, text content, and media inside your web tags (as you should always do) and avoid all that cumbersome JavaScript API code that just wrecks your layouts in dozens of browsers. Keep in mind, this CSS solution fixes issues in web browsers and website design going back over 20+ years of browser history, so it is a comprehensive yet simplified solution in addressing all the problems these browser vendors have created for us over the decades. But the fixes do not provide, nor address, fancy layout issues in older user agents, nor rewrite HTML and CSS like many JavaScripted API's might do. Those solutions do not address cross-browser issues but only fix a narrow range of browsers. That is why I recommend you delete those JavaScript API libraries from your project and just trust my solution using plain text-based CSS. All browsers know will parse and render my solution perfectly! My system also makes sure all known HTML elements are cleaned up and simplified so text content and media is presentable and readable between viewers, unlike those bloated JavaScripted API solutions. Keep in mind, I did not create this "bad browser" technology mess! Thousands of poorly trained programmers working at these companies on these web standards over the years created it. But after 20+ years of playing around in their poorly built browsers for years and years, I darn well fixed it for them. :)</p>

                <p>Give my <strong>Universal CSS Framework</strong> a try and see how much easier CSS can be without all those hacks, fixes, preprocessors, and giant JavaScripted API's that just add more and more complexity to CSS and website design. They never really solved the problem of cross-browser content delivery, yet pumped megabytes and megabytes of unnecessary code into millions of browsers and devices with every web page view while leaving millions of older user agents broken and unable to display your simple text content! Bad design!! CSS used to be a very clean, fast, simple text-based technology. You do not need scripts to build fast websites online that display properly in a web browser. Go back to the "old way" of delivering clean Cascading Style Sheets without all those crazy add-ons, goofy JavaScript, crazy browser dependencies, fancy API's, and extra extensions. Keep it simple. Try my Universal CSS Framework and see how much better and faster your websites will run!</p>

                <h2>More Information</h2>

                <p>Below is a list of additional information for this coded solution. It includes info on how to install the CSS code into your web project as well as configurations you may need to make after you do so. I have also added descriptions of various aspects of the project below that may help you get started. Very detailed commentary, browser and CSS history, and other factoids are included in the code itself. Some of that is quite detailed, so would fill too many web pages in the section below. So, I elected to avoid that and just drop in a few basics below. If you are curious about the dirty details, however, just open each CSS file in the project inside a simple text editor and read how and why every piece of code was added. You will want to remove all those comments to compact the files. Do NOT use SASS or a preprocessor to compress, minimize, rewrite, change, or process any of the CSS in this project, however, as those poorly written software systems will just rewrite and erase sensitive formatting that controls how my code is parsed. Thank you!</p>


                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>First copy-and-paste the "css" folder of files anywhere inside the directory of your website</strong> - Just paste the "css" folder of files into your website and link to it in your HTML pages (see below). You can also paste this folder inside any folder in your desktop computer, create an HTML file, amd see it work right away! After you have added your link path to the CSS, double-click your HTML web page and see it in action. No special software or server is needed when you work with plain CSS and HTML! Below is an example of how you might link to the Universal CSS Framework from an HTML web page. Paste these links below into the head section of your HTML web page and modify the paths as needed. This example below assumes your HTML page is in the same folder as the "css" master folder. Modify the file paths as needed below:

                        <br /><br />
                        <code>
                            &lt;link media="print" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="css/default/styles/Print.css?v=2.0" /&gt;<br />
                            &lt;link media="screen" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="css/default/styles/NewBrowsersImporter.css?v=2.0" /&gt;<br />
                            &lt;link media="screen" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="css/default/styles/OldBrowsers.css?v=2.0" /&gt;
                        </code>
                        <br /><br />

                    </li>

                    <li><strong>Modify the CSS Code as Needed inside the CSS Files with your own CSS Code</strong> - You will need create an HTML web page, of course, write custom CSS for your layouts, then paste that into the CSS files inside my system. Under "css/default/styles" you will want to paste in your custom styles and classes into "Styles.css" for your main desktop website design, do the same for the "Mobile.css" layout version, and modify the "Print.css" file so your web pages are perfectly printable. Note that the project only comes with basic mobile-friendly and print-friendly layout designs. All these default designs match this HTML README layout code or the one found inside my HTML5 Turtorial (link below). So use this web page or my tutorial link below to get started with a clean HTML5 template that works well with my CSS systems. Additionally, you can add your own mobile app images, print button, favicon, header logo, and high definition print logo. I have included samples in the "images" folder. There are lots of goodies to customize in the "styles" CSS folder. Just try and not modify the the CSS files (other than 3 mentioned above), beyond removing comments, as they are carefully codced with CSS hacks and tricks used to redesign the basic website designs across many older browsers. Keep in mind this CSS "reset" system does NOT rewrite your HTML nor come with HTML layouts. It simply styles the basic elements and leaves older browsers with clean white content pages so you do not have to style them in any way. It does not provide layouts for modern HTML5 pages, like grids or floats, etc. It just cleans up the HTML elements and prepares your web pages for your advanced CSS3 designs. It does set the foundation however for solid CSS3 web page layouts with improved text display, better for field display, mobile styles, print styles, addresses all the older browser issues, and cleans up any HTML items impacted by the browser's default UA element style sheets. It simply lays the "foundation" for you to build upon, while also hiding your advanced CSS designs from older browsers!</li>

                    <li>
                        <strong>How Does this CSS framework hide my advanced CSS from Older Browsers?</strong> - This new CSS system delivers clean CSS to all browsers that support style sheets, with nice fallback display for the earliest non-CSS and non-JavaScript browsers from the 1990's, as well. After 2001, a wider range of user agents came on the scene with various levels of support for CSS. This generally included the early Mozilla, Firefox, Safari, and Chrome browsers. This CSS system was designed to not just fix issues in this older range of browsers (prior to 2010), but try and hide most of your modern CSS3 designs from them. You can get more details of what browsers are hidden and not hidden in my CSS system by reading my comments inside the various CSS files. As such, This Universal CSS Framework frees you up from trying to build complex CSS or use plugins and scripts to fix page layouts in these older web browsers, saving you thousands of hours. This has the benefit your website content can now be viewed in nearly all web browsers going back 20+ years! However, it allows you the freedom to deliver more advanced styles to newer browsers while hiding those style sheets from older browsers, allowing your team to focus almost exclusively on cutting edge CSS going forward. The exception would be some later Internet Explorer browsers (IE8-11) which I discuss in the comments inside my CSS pages. In general, this framework delivers basic element styles that older browsers understand ("OldBrowser.css") while hiding newer, more advanced element style sheets ("NewBrowsers.css") through its special "import filtering" system. Newer CSS style sheets are only accessible to browsers that can read a special "@import" media CSS rule I designed that imports your advanced CSS pages into the newer browsers. Those same imports also hide certain advanced CSS style sheets from a wide range of older browsers. The main ones excluded by these imports are browsers that either do not support "@import" in CSS, or which do not support unusual coded version of the CSS rule. These unsupporting browsers include the Netscape Series, certain IE Mac series, and the Internet Explorer series for Windows version 1-7, and others discussed inside my CSS file comments. Inside this file, "css/default/styles/NewBrowsersImporter.css", you will see the import logic that links to all the advanced sheets. This mainly includes the advanced "reset" element style sheet "NewBrowsers.css" for newer browsers that fully support HTML5 elements, the "Styles.css" desktop style sheet for newer browsers, and the "Mobile.css" mobile style sheet which again older browsers should not be seeing since none of the older pre-2007 browsers ever appeared on smart phones. The latter two sheets are where you drop in all your custom styles that you want newer HTML5 browsers to see but older browser to ignore. Older browsers as mentioned will only see the "OldBrowsers.css" reset element style sheet which turns all your HTML into very simple, white, vertical content text pages. Any user viewing your site in those browsers will only see your text content, form fields, and media in clean, white vertical content pages. All the fancy designs in "Styles" and "Mobile" will only be downloaded and viewed in the newest web browsers, including any web browsers invented going forward.
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>Mobile Style Sheet</strong> - This style sheet system also includes a simple mobile browser style sheet you can customize with your own media query dimensions, styles, fonts, etc. It was designed with the most compatible CSS code possible to work in the earliest and oldest mobile phone browsers made. Remember, nearly all old browsers (pre-2007) were not used on the earliest mobile phones. So you can safely add more advanced CSS3 in your mobile sheet if you like, understanding that many cutting-edge CSS3 and HTML5 tricks may still not work across all mobile browsers even today (2022). For example, in 2022 Safari on iPhone and still has non-support of some HTML5 features in 2022. So be sure to test! The "Mobile.css" sheet like the others has fully detailed comments and instructions inside it.</li>

                    <li><strong>Print Style Sheet</strong> - This style sheet system also includes a powerful print sheet and is fully printable in old and new browsers! When you use this CSS print system along with the HTML5 code used in this README page or my HTML5 tutorial page, your website is printable right out of the box with minimal changes. A print header gets turned on with an HD logo, and the print sheet hides and restyles many structural elements for easy printing. Your webpages are then printable by your end users who will be thrilled to print clean, text-based printouts of your website. You should consider customizing the print sheet by adding your own point-based (pt) print fonts, add a nice high definition printable 300 dpi company logo, add custom page breaks as needed, redesign tabular data, and any additional changes that only affect the print versions of your website content. Remember that browsers old and new ONLY read your "Print.css" style sheet when "print" is triggered in the web browser. The print system ignores all your other style pages. So, they may look radically different. In the print sheet, I have added the necessary imports of the other sheets so they get the basic styles needed. If you add more website sheets be sure to add your own. The "Print.css" sheet like the others has fully detailed comments and instructions inside it.</li>

                    <li><strong>Why did I use a "default" Folder?</strong> - Under the "css" folder is a folder called "default" that holds all the styles, fonts, and images used in the CSS system. This folder is called a "skins" (theme or layout) folder and allows you to copy and past multiple copies of itself, give the folder a new name, modify the CSS inside it with new designs, and link to the new folder. You then have a new skin for your website! This structure is a superior way of managing dozens of skins or themes for your website with minimal effort and maximum control. Its very easy for development teams to associate new logical style sheet themes with the physical folder structure, rather than complexity abstracted out in JavaScript and scattered across various software systems, cloud servers, and databases which just patch your CSS together with complicated customization scripts that are difficult to manage. By simply copying the "default" folder, renaming it, and recoding its CSS, you suddenly have a brand new skin for your website, but one that starts with the previous theme. You can add dozens of skins this way. I have built many of these "CSS skins"" for website products I built and sold online. Just link to each skin using a new path. Thats it! Your development team will love this as its so simple to use, and each folder can be a new branch or repo in Git, or simply a CSS folder you hand off to a web designer to work on separate from the team. In fact, you could store the skin folder or its path in a database and manage your skins that way.</li>

                    <li><strong>Dependencies?</strong> - There are NO DEPENDENCIES in this CSS framework! No additonal software or scripts are required to code it, run it, or see it work with a simple HTML page. Why? I hate website dependencies! I especially despise JavaScript API's', SASS, Modernizr, preprocessors, extensions, polyfills, and anything that shoves megabytes of added code and complexity into people's web browsers. It is just unnecessary. Cascading Style Sheets have run perfectly for over 20 years without any of that nasty stuff kids write today. For that reason my CSS framework has NO dependencies and does not benefit from them at all. You can paste my CSS system into projects and modify it with a simple change via a text editor and it will run smoothly and efficently. CSS in web browser will NOT block content delivery, nor slow down parsing, painting, or rendering of your web project in the DOM of any web browser known, with or without modifications, minimizing, etc. It does not need any of that! (I have written articles about this on stackoverflow). When testing this CSS, you can open up a simple HTML file on your desktop and see your CSS changes immediately in your HTML webpage without even a server! CSS was designed to work that way with no dependencies, no servers, co compiling, no pre-processing, and no scripting. It is just plain text the browser manages and parses just fine. Besides, Cascading Style Sheets are open source, free, and standardized by default. They require no software to run, and are owned by no company or organization. <strong>Cascading Style Sheets</strong> will NEVER have dependencies beyond a few lines of HTML and a browser to view it in. Unless some kid forces your CSS into their proprietary JavaScript API or the next lame software IDE, CSS needs nothing else to run beyond a web browser! You can safely type CSS in any text editor and save it. It does not need compilation, scripting, or preprocessing ever to run, and run efficiently. So my Universal CSS Framework was designed to work as plain text files that you control, you modify, and you can see working in your HTML web pages at any time without any modifications whatsover!</li>

                    <li><strong>Does this CSS Solution use both "Progressive Enhancement" and "Graceful Degradation" in Web Browsers?</strong> - Both these terms are some goofy names some kids made up on the Internet for things that have no real meaning in the web development world. <strong>It is common sense that ALL websites should be designed this way for older browsers!</strong> You should always build websites to work in older browsers starting with a simple baseline design that works in all but delivers advanced features to newer user agents, while allowing CSS layouts to get simpler in older browsers. Most developers have been doing this for over 20 years. So ignore these terms. They are the same thing as the older term, "cross-browser compatibility". But if you insist on asking if this solution does those two things, then the answer is YES! The "reset CSS"  sheets provide a foundation of solid HTML layout and design which allows you to ""progressively"" add newer CSS technology for the modern browsers that support it, while "degrading gracefully", delivery to very old browsers a simple, primitive vertical white design for text content. So this <strong>Universal CSS Framework</strong> fullfills both requirements!</li>

                    <li><strong>Need More Help?</strong> - If you need more detailed information about my Universal CSS Framework, how it works, how to install it, how to link to it, etc., just open up any of the projects CSS files under the "styles folder" (css/default/styles/...). I have added detailed comments on how each and every piece of code works! Be sure to read the README text files in each folder, as well. The one in the "styles" folder has additonal instructions and detailed information.</li>

                    <li><strong>Need a clean HTML starter page? Want to use my Modern HTML5 Website System to help you get started?</strong> - You can now get a nice HTML starter page that works well with my Universal CSS System right out of the box! In fact, you can copy the code in this README page (written in modern HTML5) by right-clicking it and choosing "viewsource". Simply copy that code into a new ".html" web page, link to your "css" files, and you are done. This page has all the basic HTML5 code needed to start building a solid cross-browser web page. Or even better....you can access the same basic HTML with even more options and goodies by visiting my online tutorial and copying some HTML5 web page template code under the "Best Practices" section. There are two (2) solid examples of good, cross-browser HTML5 website pages that run well with my Universal CSS framework located there, as well as comprehensive HTML5 code examples and instructions on best practices using every single HTML element ever made the past 20 years! One even includes a nice cross-browser "grid" layout system that supports many browsers already baked in.
