Description: This is a project I call the "Universal CSS Framework". This powerful cascading style sheet (CSS) system supports universal website design in all known web browsers going back to the birth of the World Wide Web in the 1990's. It is simply a small package of CSS files you drag-and-drop into your website and which "resets" the web browser's HTML element designs so they consistently display your website's elements in many types of web browsers. This CSS system also offers you a more advanced CSS system for managing how older and newer browsers view your website's HTML and CSS by hiding modern CSS designs from older browsers and degrading gracefully your HTML layouts for those older user agents. As such, this CSS system has been carefully designed to allow your websites to perform well in 99.99% of web browsers past and present without having to use eleborate custom CSS hacks, install complex JavaScript API libraries, struggle with half-baked polyfills, or implement styles sheet preprocessor dependencies. It uses plain CSS text!

Using this style sheet framework, older browsers will get plain white, vertical content pages with san-serif black fonts, while newer and more modern browsers will get your cutting-edge, CSS3 designs. This system achieves that using special CSS rules that older browsers do not understand. These newer style sheets are hidden from the old browsers using a special "@import" style sheet trick all known modern browsers understand but older ones do not. The older browsers get a simpler reset element style sheet, while modern browsers get a more advanced reset elemtn sheet plus your custom CSS layout styles. This includes full support for advanced mobile and print designs using CSS. The following older browsers are now hidden from these newer style sheets using @import rules in this CSS framework:

- Netscape 1-4.8 
- Opera 1-3.5
- Windows Internet Explorer 1-7.x
- Macintosh Internet Explorer 2-4.5
- Konqueror 1-2.1
- Windows Amaya 1-5.1
- iCab 1-2
- OmniWeb
- Many more antiquated browsers...

With this solutions I aim to deliver simple, cut-and-paste HTML and CSS code that new web developers can use with minimal customization. My CSS framework will allow you to deliver viewable content in 20+ years worth of historical browsers, while allowing your teams to safely move forward with cutting-edge web technology used in the browsers of tomorrow.

Also, I have posted a complete HTML5 Tutorial on my website which works well with this CSS system. It has a complete modern HTML5 element sample coding list, history of every HTML element since the 1990's, a "Best Practices" section, template web pages with cross-browser grids/flex examples, recommended markup attributes, WAI-ARIA attributes for the blind, and lists of HTML/CSS code to avoid that still is not supported in modern HTML5 browsers. What is even better is my HTML5 code works perfectly with this Universal CSS Framework! Using the two systems combined (HTML and CSS), you can deliver powerful cross-browser web pages that load lightning fast and parse perfectly in browsers, past and present. You can even use my README.html page in this project as an HTML5 template, as it has all the same "best practices" markup code. Or simply visit my HTML5 Tutorial link below for all the goodies!

If you want to get more detailed information about this project, you will have to copy my code then view my "README.html" file. It is written in clean HTML5 markup, can be opened in any web browser, and is styled by the CSS system found in this project. It is superior to GitPages, Jekyll, Markdown, and all the other goofy new frameworks that require complicated coding, settings, and other routines to work. Stick with plan CSS and HTML and you always widen your viewing audience!
