Note: Please view my "README.html" file instead of this README.md file for more project details. You will have to download the full project of files to your desktop to view it in your web browsers as the GitHub "readme" system does not even understand basic HTML or CSS!

Description: This is a project I call the "Universal CSS Framework". This powerful cascading style sheet (CSS) system supports universal website design in all known web browsers going back to the birth of the World Wide Web in the 1990's. It is simply a small package of CSS files you drag-and-drop into your website and which "resets" the web browser's HTML element designs so they consistently display your website's elements in many types of web browsers. This CSS system also offers you a more advanced CSS system for managing how older and newer browsers view your website's HTML and CSS by hiding modern CSS designs from older browsers and degrading gracefully your HTML layouts for those older user agents. As such, this CSS system has been carefully designed to allow your websites to perform well in 99% of web browsers past and present without having to use eleborate custom CSS hacks, install complex JavaScript API libraries, struggle with half-baked polyfills, or implement styles sheet preprocessor dependencies. It uses plain CSS text!

If you want to get more detailed information about this project, you will have to copy my code then view my "README.html" file. It is written in clean HTML5 markup, can be opened in any web browser, and is styled by the CSS styles found in the project. It is superior to GitPages, Jekyll, Markdown, and all the other goofy new frameworks that require complicated coding, settings, and other routines. Stick with plan CSS and HTML (which have been around 20+ years) and you always widen your viewing audience!

Also, I have posted a complete HTML5 Tutorial on my website which works well with this CSS system. It has a complete modern HTML5 element sample coding list, history of every HTML element since the 1990's, a "Best Practices" section, HTML5 template pages with cross-browser grids/flex examples, recommended markup attributes, ARIA examples for blind, and which HTML code to avoid that still is not supported in modern HTML5 browsers. What is even better is my HTML5 code works perfectly with my CSS solution! Using the two systems combined (HTML and CSS), you can deliver powerful cross-browser web pages that load lightning fast and parse perfectly in browser, past and present. You can even use my README.html page in this project as an HTML template in your project as it has all the same goodies. Or simply visit my HTML5 Tutorial link below for all the goodies!

Note on Using Markdown Files: GitHub asks us to use their "README.md" file system. But after many struggles I found it to be pretty useless."README" files were meant to allow software developers a simple way to show helpful text files. But this "README.md" format uses an inferior page design language called "Markdown". After running tests in this language, I found serious flaws. This language fails in multiple ways, including the fact it has almost zero text formatting abilities, does not support Cascading Style Sheets formatting like HTML, does not support the majority of HTML5 elements, and you have to download extensions and add-ons to see a page preview. You are better off just writing plain README.txt files in text! You also cannot view Markdown files (.md) in any known web browser without downloading even more extensions, add-ons, or plugins. In Visual Studio I found no simple way of even seeing what my README looked like without digging around for more add-ons. This is just terrible design! The "Jekyll" site generator is even worse...add any specialized HTML code in your file and watch it get rewritten into an inferior version of itself. Why rewrite someone's HTML, markup, XML, CSS, or Markdown code into even more inferior code? Why not just allow people to write their own HTML? So I had to abandon it complete. 

Be sure to view my "README.html" file instead.
